<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Last night, I was hacking on a small utility library for use when using HTML5 localStorage. When you work with localStorage, it often gets into repetitive state when use use same command again and again. This library just abstracts the process and makes things easier for you. It would work on all modern browsers.<br /><br /><pre><code class="javascript">/**<br /> * Ldb.js<br /> * Copyright(c)2013  Vinit Kumar <vinit .kumar="" changer.nl=""><br /> * MIT Licensed<br /> */<br /><br />var Ldb = function () {};<br /><br />/**<br /> * [check Checks for localStorage support on the browsers]<br /> * @return {[String]} [status of localStorage Support]<br /> */<br />Ldb.prototype.check = function () {<br />  if (!localStorage) {<br />    return 'Please use a Modern browser, your browser does not support localStorage yet';<br />  } else {<br />    return 'Bingo, your Browsers supports localStorage, phew!';<br />  }<br />};<br /><br />/**<br /> * [get Gives the data stored in the key]<br /> * @param  {[String]} key [Key to retrive the data stored in localStorage]<br /> * @return {[JSON]}     [The JSON data stored | Error message saying no data stored with that key]<br /> */<br />Ldb.prototype.get = function (key) {<br />  if (localStorage.getItem(key)) {<br />    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key));<br />  } else {<br />    return 'No such key exists, Are you sure you have saved data with the key?';<br />  }<br />};<br /><br />/**<br /> * [set Saved data in the localStorage database]<br /> * @param {[String]} key   []<br /> * @param {[JSON]} value [The JSON data that gets stored in the localStorage]<br /> */<br />Ldb.prototype.set = function(key, value) {<br />  if (typeof (value) === 'object') {<br />    var stringValue = JSON.stringify(value);<br />    localStorage.setItem(key, stringValue);<br />    return 'Successfully saved your data to the key' + key +' key!';<br />  }<br />};<br /><br />/**<br /> * [remove description]<br /> * @param  {[String]} key [Key for the data to be deleted]<br /> * @return {[String]}     [Status message for the remove operation]<br /> */<br />Ldb.prototype.remove = function(key) {<br />  if (localStorage.getItem(key)) {<br />    localStorage.removeItem(key);<br />    return 'Successfully removed data with the key'+ key +' !';<br />  } else {<br />    return 'No such key exists, nothing to remove';<br />  }<br />};<br /></vinit><br /></code><br /></pre><br />This is all code for the utility as of now. More features are going to flow in coming weeks. Also, you can just install it using 'npm install ldb' or 'bower install ldb.js'.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">In Software development, there are so many things to learn. Especially, if you are web developer there are so many things to learn. Should you learn Rails, Django or .NET? Or should you learn Angular, Backbone or Ember?<br /><br />It is a very tricky question and has been puzzling me for quite sometime. But some time back, it kind of dawned on me that I should just try and own one technology at one time. Say if it's Django try and learn everything about Django. Become the best in your company at Django. The benefits are two fold:<br />- You will have a stable career and you will be happy with the quality of your work.<br />- You can use that understanding of that technology with understanding and learning other technologies really fast.<br /><br />Another problem that I sometime face is lack of motivation to learn if something gets really tough. I learned that instead of setting a super tough goal, I should rather split it up and own it one by one. First of all, it gives me a sense of achievement and confidence. Also, my whole effort would be on completing that goal with best of my abilities.<br /><br />The things I said above is not rocket science, but if you are at my stage of learning. It might be useful to you.<br /><br /><br />With that said, May the Force be with you!<br /><br /><pre><span style="color: lime;">                ____                  <br />                _.' :  `._               <br />            .-.'`.  ;   .'`.-.           <br />   __      / : ___\ ;  /___ ; \      __  <br /> ,'_ ""--.:__;".-.";: :".-.":__;.--"" _`,<br /> :' `.t""--..

There are endless stories about all the stuff that doesn't even matter to us. We are being fed so much about our friends that we are not even interested to know about them anymore. Sharing every crap that happens in your life is a common norm and anyone who doesn't stick to it is dated.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, that fact is, we should just shut this information overload and take control of our life. We don't really need to be subjected to this and become depressed and deprived people. Life has better meaning than all of it. We are born to do great things in life and not being sucked into this emotional and depressing wormhole that these Social Networks are creating.</div><div><br /></div><div>With that said, not all of the Social Networks are bad. Some of them like Twitter and Google+ gives us the option to minimise the intrusion of this excess information. So take a stand and control what kind of information gets to you. Clean up your friends and following list. Follow only those person and group you are really passionate &nbsp;about. Pick up some nice offline activity, meet some nice people , play some music, watch sunrise or sunset, start running etc. There are so many nice things to do. So just shut up laptop/tablets/smartphones and get some life people!</div></div>

      <p><div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Software development could be a very tiring and demanding process. Putting 80 hour weeks running after a goal that may or maybe not be achieved and then getting into depression is not right.<br /><br />One should optimise his work and workplace for happiness. Setup small easy goals that you could really achieve and celebrate it every time. It is good to be ambitious but it is insanely stupid to make super tough goal with out some real practise.<br /><br />Start small, &nbsp;reach your goal and next time try to do it more efficiently. People say that 'Failures are the pillars of success' , I would humbly disagree. It is these small successes that are pillars of some big successes. Look around yourself. Just take chess for example: Someone doesn't becomes a grandmaster because he had been defeated by every other grandmaster. Likewise don't obsess with failure. Better start winning by doing something nice today however small it maybe.<br /><br />Failure is a good thing to do some self evaluation and getting better where it's needed. &nbsp;Treat it as a unit test, so that you know what tests are failing and what you could do to solve them. Solve them and come out with flying colors.<br /><br />Life is way too small to waste and be sad and depressed.<br />Think about it! :)<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/447/176/447176815_640.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/447/176/447176815_640.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div></div>

      <h2><a href="/2013/07/seven-tips-to-get-better-at-writing-code.html">Seven Tips To Get Better At Writing Code</a></h2>
      <p class="post-date">20 Jul 2013</p>

      <p><div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Every developer dreams of getting better at writing code. He/She wants his code to be clean and pragmatic. But this doesn't happen on its own. Here are some tips to get better at writing code.<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Follow TDD: Test driven development is a great way to improve your code. It ensures that whatever functionality you have implemented is doing what it is supposed to do. One should make sure to spend some time writing tests before writing a feature. It is a difficult practise to inculcate in your developers, but believe me the amount of time and stress you will save with it &nbsp;is phenomenal. &nbsp;There are basically two types of tests that should be present with your code: &nbsp;unit tests and integrations tests. Both are very important. Sometimes, it might not be possible to get everything unit tested but make sure key parts have units tests and integrations tests are complete.&nbsp;</li><li>Write detailed commit messages: &nbsp;I can't recommend this one enough. Ever since i am introduced to this practise, i could easily feel the improvement in me and my code. It prefer it to writing long comments in my code. Wherever you did something that needs to be explained or if you did a hack to resolve some particular issue, make sure you address these parts in your commit message. It really helps because whenever your codebase gets bigger.A new developers could just take a look at the code and commit message and will be more comfortable getting up to speed. Also, if you are working on an open source project or contributing to one, chances are really high that your pull request will be merged. &nbsp;One reason for this is that, the person merging your code will not have to dive deep into your code to make sense of that you did back there. Your 'detailed commit message' will serve its purpose then.</li><li>Teach yourself about writing maintainable code: Always, try to think about writing maintainable code. It might not be possible every time, since sometimes deadlines won't allow it. But make a point to revisit that code and fix that hackery you did back there to resolve the issue. This is really important, because sooner to later, that hackery/bug will come to bite you again and things could get really ugly.</li><li>Know your editor: You should and must configure your editor for the language your code on. It must have all the required plugins to do live linting while you code. If you do python or JS, there are some pretty great plugins available for both the languages in Vim and Sublime Text2. Also, get familiar with some good snippets generating plugins for frameworks, HTML and CSS. There are pretty great plugins to beautify and minify your code as well. They really help in getting the whole code quality better.</li><li>Automate all repetitive tasks: At this time, we are pretty much equipped with the technologies such as grunt and yeoman which could automate a lot of part that you had to waste your time doing again and again. You must also learn about git hooks. For example: I made a git pre-commit hook to compile less into css and run jshint, concat and uglify operations on my javascript code any time someone changes them. This is great because my workflow prevents any bad code to enter the codebase.</li><li>Read good code, data structures and Algorithms: There is no end of learning. Teach yourself to read more and more good code. You must spend time getting better with data structures and algorithms. They might not prove useful immediately, but it will make you a better developer and will enable you to take better decisions in future.</li><li>Watch talks and presentations: Be regular to watch great talks and presentations from the various conferences round the year. They give some pretty great information about the latest trends and techniques. You could easily find them on YouTube/Vimeo and SpeakerDeck.&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gXvgVkXBX4c/UeqghTlgEBI/AAAAAAAACAU/aYPFFsvrRtE/s1600/yoda.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="190" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gXvgVkXBX4c/UeqghTlgEBI/AAAAAAAACAU/aYPFFsvrRtE/s400/yoda.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div></div>

    One thing which comes in my mind is to make use of less keystrokes i.e. to write less but should be understable. Even character layout works great, character displays everything in a simple way.
