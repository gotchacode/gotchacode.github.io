      <h2><a href="/2012/09/what-gnulinux-could-learn-from-apple.html">What GNU/Linux Could Learn From Apple</a></h2>
      <p class="post-date">02 Sep 2012</p>

      <p><div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">A lot of recent posts on Hacker News suggest that Linux is dead on Desktop and OS X killed it. Well I don't think that it is still dead or it will be ever.<br />Instead of Lamenting on it, we should learn from our mistakes and also from success of OS X. Here are some of things we could do:<br /><br /><b>User Interface</b>: This is one place where OS X beats Linux by huge margin, Apple hire the best graphic designers and they put a lot of effort on how it looks and how&nbsp;intuitive is feels. Linux really need to improve on the UI specially we need excellent graphic designers that can create the next gen graphics. We could also take a lesson from Androids, they look awesome and they have a Linux at the core. The problem of fragmentation can be get rid with a unified great looking Desktop Environment that is functional as well as beautiful. We could always have the choice of other DE, but there should be one that could cater of masses of people who just want there OS to work and don't have the technical aptitude to tweak it.<br /><br /><b>Softwares</b>: This is one place where we have a lead. The only problem is that we don't have as much third party developers developing for Linux. One way to fix that is that we could have a central Software center that could provides softwares for almost all the Linux Distributions. Package management system could be merged into one or we could have a same package management in addition to the other package manager specific to that distro.<br /><br /><br /><b>Stability</b>: This is one thing that really needs to be addressed very seriously. No user wants his OS to crash performing an update or release upgrade. These issues should be addressed from the smallest level and only stable kernels should be included. Also advanced filesystem such as ZFS or BRFTS should be included as soon as possible such that we do fast backups and full system rollback.<br /><br /><b>Focus on Developers</b>: OS X earned a huge advantage because it focused on developers and provided everything they need on a very stable environment. We need to beat them in that. We have all the tools , we just need to make it more organized and less painful. Any new release should make it their first priority to see that setting a &nbsp;development environment is as easy as clicking a button on software center or by a unified command that fetches all dependencies. They could be grouped as say Rails Development, Python Development, PHP Development. Surely we can trim these unified packages if we need. But a developer not used to Linux would like to start with his development as soon as possible without learning to mess with the Operating system."<b><i>Just Works</i></b>" is a important factor that we need to focus on<i>.<b>It is very crucial because these are the developer who will build third party apps and availability of these apps could only attract masses to adopt Linux.</b></i><br /><i><b><br /></b></i>We need to play on our strengths rather than trying to imitate Apple. They have their limits, We have freedom to choose, We can offer our OS for free, They can't. We can give away open source softwares for free, They cant do that.With the other Hardware manufactures catching up soon, Apple won't have a next gen leap with their hardware. Android devices have already proved it is possible.<br /><i><b><br /></b></i><i style="font-weight: bold;">Imagine an OS with a UI better than Macs, and free softwares in vast Apt Repositories(just an example..don't kill me for it). Stability and full drivers support. This could be </i><b>Linux </b><b><i>that could really be the </i>Desktop of the Year.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b><b>P.S Everyone who hates these ideas are welcome to suggest better ones, i am just suggesting ideas and I am sure there are better ones.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><br /><br /></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Github is easily the world's largest repository for projects with almost all major companies as well as Startups &nbsp;use them to deploy their code or contribute to Open Source.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is a small infographic of Top 10 Languages that are used to create projects at Github.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HJeXwmNDfoo/UELkbL4YMHI/AAAAAAAAA1k/x6851ZQ7k_0/s1600/screen5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="195" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HJeXwmNDfoo/UELkbL4YMHI/AAAAAAAAA1k/x6851ZQ7k_0/s400/screen5.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;I will try to analyze what we can deduce from this data.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">JavaScript, Ruby and Python take first three places. It was quite obvious because Developers are more focused to develop stuff for web and these languages provide everything you need to create a great looking website or App that can scale. Node , Rails and Django are the most famous projects that are trending nowadays.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">One shocker is Shell Beating Java and PHP, well all we can make out from this data is that most of people or a huge percentage using Github are *nix users (either OS X or Linux ) . One factor can also be that people might not want to Open Source there java projects or PHP ones.Its a highly competitive market and sure we can't blame them.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Next up we have C, C++ , Perl and Objective-C. It was obvious because C and C++ are tougher to learn compared to languages such as python, Ruby or JavaScript.Objective-C in the list shows that iOS developers are also contributing to Open Source projects at Github.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This data might not be accurate to the developers language choice and Projects, but surely gives us a view of what current trend is.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It is a famous quote from an artwork at Mark Zuckerberg's workplace. Well this post has nothing to do with Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg.<br />Rather this article will give you some cool hacks/tips on how you can optimize or build your development setup.<br /><br />The important factors hardware, software, Language and services are mentioned here:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Hardware: Choose a hardware that gives you least trouble to setup, if possible always have a secondary screen while using &nbsp;a netbook/laptop. More screen real estate is always handy. Use SSD in place of normal SATA hard drive. You will be amazed by how much faster your system will behave.Don't compromise on RAM, the more the memory the better it is. Another important thing is that&nbsp;<u>Never mix your development machine with your desktop machine</u>. You will have less distraction and much better result.I would suggest building your own machine as it will give your more freedom and will save your precious money that you can invest in other gears. If you are inclined to develop on Linux shy away from nvidia graphics. ATI gives fewer problems.A Noise cancelling headphone and a ergonomic keyboard are also a valuable addition.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Software: If you want a fairly current and stable development environment I would suggest you use something like Ubuntu or Debian as your development OS. They are pretty mainstream, have the largest repository in planet, anything that will be introduced to Linux will reach your pretty soon. Also the biggest benefit is that you won't have to waste countless hours to configure it. Fedora/Arch/Gentoo is good to learn Linux but they take pretty huge amount of time to configure. And if u are a developer who is past that stage probably you won't like to get in that mess. Some may argue about an OS X as a choice of development platform. I would not&nbsp;hesitate&nbsp;to say that it can be an excellent choice given the hardware and operating system is of world class. Also if you developing apps for iOS or OS X you should stick to Apple Ecosystem. The only thing that can bug you is that you can get every development&nbsp;environment free in Ubuntu/Debian for which you might need to loose some money to buy stuff from App Store.One more important thing is that you should invest sometime to learn some very important utilities on a&nbsp;UNIX&nbsp;platform like basic shell scripting, some command line and get&nbsp;acquainted&nbsp;with &nbsp;Vim/Emacs and tmux or screen. Once you master these things it will give a a huge advantage and you will be able to do more efficient&nbsp;development.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Language : Its purely &nbsp;a matter of choice but having a scripting language such as perl, ruby or python and a low level language such as C will give u a great deal of advantage.Also if you are a web-based guy do learn ruby,&nbsp;JavaScript, CSS.Plus some server side knowledge will always be useful to you.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Services: Always try to follow and use mainstream and proven services such that you will have greater acceptance.eg: Github. Also blog about your work and subscribe to a mailing list. It will always keep you informed and current.</li></ul><div>In the end, you should always prefer a test driven, well documented clean code such that it will be easier to integrate or spawn newer functionality in your product.</div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Every weekend I will be showcasing some awesome projects that will be termed as Hack of the Week.<br />This week "Hack of the Week " is <a href="http://myusuf3.github.com/octogit/" target="_blank">Octogit</a>. Its a Python project that gives a command line interface to connect to Github and it lets you hack on your project without opening the Github web interface.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mh-84NV1-F0/UEH8aL2JCTI/AAAAAAAAA1U/L4dJQ25wHoU/s1600/screen4.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mh-84NV1-F0/UEH8aL2JCTI/AAAAAAAAA1U/L4dJQ25wHoU/s320/screen4.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Octogit in Action</td></tr></tbody></table>Its an incredibly useful tool in your arsenal, why? Because all you need to do now is to login using your Github username and password and then you can create your Repository, Sort our issues, Open them, Close them. Does everything you always wanted to do without leaving your&nbsp;faithful&nbsp;terminal. While it might now appeal to Windows Developers as much but for OS X and Linux/BSD users it is a boon if you are using Github to deploy your code.<br /><br /><br /><u>What it does very well</u>: Gives a damn easy way to work with our favorite &nbsp;Github in command line mode.<br /><br /><u>What it could also have</u>: It would be pretty awesome if it could somehow allow to post Gist ( a popular Github pastebin service) along with other features it have. Though it is possible to achieve it using some Vim and Emacs plugins.<br /><br />You can connect with the Hacker here: <a href="http://mahdiyusuf.com/" target="_blank">Mahdi yusuf</a><br /><br />Installing it is simple:<br />Just type in your terminal: &nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">pip install octogit.</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h2 style="text-align: left;">Vim as a Developer IDE</h2><div>Every developer has a favorite text editor that he uses for his daily development work. If you are a OS X or Linux User, this should be your case for sure. Dotfiles or Vim config files are something every developer cherishes and flaunts as it is a result of hours of practice and years of compilations. Here are my Vim config files and plugins.I will be posting&nbsp;screenshots&nbsp;of these plugins and link to download them easily.<br /><br />But first of all why Vim ? Why not something else?<br /><br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>There is only one valid competitor of Vim , Emacs still why you should consider using vim. The answer is simplicity, elegance and the&nbsp;efficiency&nbsp;you achieve using vim is&nbsp;unparalleled. Vim had always had a big user community and after decades of development and bug fixes this software is near perfection.&nbsp;</li><li>There are a lot useful plugins readily available and constantly new and innovative plugins that integrates you with latest services like Twitter, Github are present and much more are shipped on a daily basis.</li><li>It works really well as your experience grows and almost every time you type in some code or text your finger would automatically search the same functionality everywhere else.It becomes so effective.</li><li>Whether you are developer on OS X or Linux, it doesn't matter at all. Where ever u go, with your same .vimrc and .vim/ files you will feel right at home. Unlike Emacs you don't need a learn LISP to master Emacs. Emacs are nice but they require much more effort then vim and considering the result is almost the same why not better use Vim.</li></ul></div><div>Here are some of plugins showcased via screenshots just to give u a feel of vim.<br /><br /></div><div>There are plenty of useful plugins, in the first you can see the nerdtree( it provides an easy interface to switch between files u are working on. Next you can see proper syntax highlighting with &nbsp;language support. In the last one you can see that you can publish your code to web Github Gist just by using a simple Gist Command. Sounds fancy right. Well I assure you the learning curve is steep only for a while , once you are past that stage you will be fast and efficient as hell.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I am posting the link of the vim <a href="https://github.com/vinitcool76/dotvim" target="_blank">dotfiles</a>, you can easily clone them using git or download as .zip &nbsp;or .tar.gz compressed files. All u need to do is unpack the file and copy the contents in your home directory.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Gotchacode was earlier hosted on&nbsp;WordPress, But recently i was forced to switched to Bloggers.Here are some of the reasons that are responsible for this shift.<br /><br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>WordPress&nbsp;is getting complicated day by day, I like the open source version where you are hosting it on your server, but with wordpress.com its too much of a time waste.&nbsp;</li><li>There are thousands and thousands of themes, most of them are useless and you will never find the one theme that could help you with what you want to do.Mine is a tech blog and i needed a theme that would support code syntax highlighting and at the same time look pretty. I am sorry to say but it never happened.</li><li>You can't use plugins of your own if u are using the free version at wordpress.com.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Don't take me wrong by reading my rant about&nbsp;WordPress, &nbsp;I just want to say that&nbsp;WordPress&nbsp;isn't innovating anymore. The&nbsp;infrastructure that once grew it isn't helpful anymore. Moreover when your search everything on&nbsp;Google&nbsp;why not switch to a service that is owned by&nbsp;Google.</div><div>But recently Bloggers has undergone huge changes and here are what makes it an excellent choice.</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>First and foremost, the recent upgrade in the dashboard and integration with&nbsp;Google+ makes its a breeze to use.</li><li>The Dynamic view template is one of cleanest and most innovative of the themes i ever came across in &nbsp;a blogging service.</li><li>Effortless integration with the Google&nbsp;Adsense and other money making engines.</li><li>Blogger is also available in command line mode, with the <a href="http://github.com/vinitcool76/googlecl">GoogleCL</a>, so i will never need to go to he&nbsp;loathe&nbsp;and slow web-interface of the&nbsp;WordPress.Agree there are clients for that, but if u are a command line guy, you will probably don't care for it.</li><li>Scaling: Who gets more hits then Google and who knows to handle traffic better than them. So it is quite an impossibility to face any downtime with it.</li></ul><div>At last all i would like to say that Sorry WordPress, you were quite good in the start, but now i don't think i can take the pain of hosting my blog on yours. &nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;</div></div>
