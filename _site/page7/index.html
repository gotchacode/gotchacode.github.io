      <p class="post-date">02 May 2011</p>

      <p><div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<em><strong>The social network breaks an unwritten rule by giving away plans to its new data center—an action it hopes will make the Web more efficient.</strong></em><br/><br/>Just weeks before switching on a massive, super-efficient data center in rural Oregon, Facebook is giving away the designs and specifications to the whole thing online. In doing so, the company is breaking a long-established unwritten rule for Web companies: don't share the secrets of your server-stuffed data warehouses.<br/><br/>Ironically, most of those secret servers rely heavily on open source or free software, for example the Linux operating system and the Apache webserver. Facebook's move—dubbed the Open Compute Project—aims to kick-start a similar trend with hardware.<br/><br/>"Mark [Zuckerberg] was able to start Facebook in his dorm room because PHP and Apache and other free and open-source software existed," says David Recordon, who helps coordinate Facebook's use of, and contribution to, open-source software. "We wanted to encourage that for hardware, and release enough information about our data center and servers that someone else could go and actually build them."<br/><br/>The attitude of other large technology firms couldn't be more different, says <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ricardob/" target="_blank">Ricardo Bianchini</a>, who researches energy-efficient computing infrastructure at Rutgers University. "Typically, companies like Google or Microsoft won't tell you anything about their designs," he says. A more open approach could help the Web as a whole become more efficient, he says. "Opening up the building like this will help researchers a lot, and also other industry players," he says. "It's opening up new opportunities to share and collaborate."<br/><br/>The open hardware designs are for a new data center in Prineville, Oregon, that will be switched on later this month. The 147,000-square-foot building will increase Facebook's overall computing capacity by around half; the social network already processes some 100 million new photos every day, and its user base of over 500 million is growing fast.<br/><br/>The material being made available—<a href="http://opencompute.org/" target="_blank">on a new website</a>—includes detailed specifications of the building's electrical and cooling systems, as well as the custom designs of the servers inside. Facebook is dubbing the approach "open" rather than open-source because its designs won't be subject to a true open-source legal license, which requires anyone modifying them to share any changes they make.<br/><br/>The plans reveal the fruits of Facebook's efforts to create one of the most energy-efficient data centers ever built. Unlike almost every other data center, Facebook's new building doesn't use chillers to cool the air flowing past the servers. Instead, air from the outside flows over foam pads moistened by water sprays to cool by evaporation. The building is carefully oriented so that prevailing winds direct outside air into the building in both winter and summer.

<strong><strong><a title="iPad 2 : Thinner, Lighter and  Faster!  " href="http://gotchacode.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/ipad-2-launched/">iPad 2 : Thinner, Lighter and  <strong>Faster</strong>!</a></strong></strong><br/><br/>Amit Kr<br/><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p><br/><strong><a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ipad_front_201103021.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-523 aligncenter" title="ipad_front_20110302" src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ipad_front_201103021.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="252" /></a></strong><br/><p style="text-align:center;">The new iPad2 ©</p><br/><strong>Now </strong>that the new iPad 2 has finally been announced; many of you might have been wondering if it is worth the efforts (read long queues) and the money to buy a new iPad 2. Well, I think the answer is a resounding Yes!! Apple has come with some innovative new features and great upgrades in iPad 2.  Here we preview some of the features of iPad 2 and also compare it with iPad so it is easy for our readers to decide if iPad 2 is worth the upgrade.<br/><br/>iPad 2 comes with a <strong>long list of features</strong>.  The first thing that got us excited in iPad 2 is the smart cover. There's a new cover for the device, which is best defined by Steve Jobs himself: "We designed the case right alongside the product. It's not a case -- it's a cover." Basically, it's a magnetic flap that protects the front and automatically wakes and puts the device to sleep according to whether it's open or closed. It takes only milliseconds to open and close the cover and the whole process is flawless.<br/><br/>The new iPad 2 is 15% lighter than iPad and at 613 grams , it feels very comfortable to hold in hands.  It is also 33% thinner than the original iPad and at just 8.8 mm, you really forget the device and get immersed in the Apple feeling.<br/><br/>You must have heard that external looks are not everything. It is what inside the heart that counts. Apple does not disappoint us at that too. With the new A5 Dual Core processor; the new iPad2 is claimed by Apple to be twice as fast and the graphics performance is up to nine times better than on the original iPad, while power requirements have been kept the same. Battery life is great with Apple promising 10 hours. That means you can keep yourself hooked to movies on that trans-Atlantic flight without worrying about recharge.<br/><br/>One of the great things about iPad 2 is the dual cameras : Front and rear cameras.  The front camera is a VGA camera that can be used for facetime chats with other iPad, iPhone, iPod, and Mac users.  The rear camera can shoot 720p HD video at 30 fps.<br/><br/>The new iPad will come with the newest version of Apple’s mobile operating system iOS 4.3.  This update enables better performance while using the Safari Internet browser, iTunes home sharing and Airplay improvements. It will also include the Wi-Fi hotspot capabilities found in the Verizon iPhones.<br/><br/>With built in gyroscope, high end processors and new apps for iMovie and GarageBand; the iPad 2 is a great multimedia experience.<br/><br/><strong>Pricing :</strong><br/><br/><strong>AT&amp;T introduced </strong><a href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=19258&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=31658&amp;mapcode=broadband|consumer">two new postpaid plans for tablets</a>, a category that includes the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/02/apple-announces-ipad-2-in-2-colors-will-feature-dual-cameras-an/">upcoming iPad 2</a>. Unlike prepaid plans which require customers to buy data allotments upfront, these new plans can be added to a customer's current monthly cellular bill. This new postpaid option is month-to-month and does not require a long-term commitment.<br/><br/>Pricing for the postpaid plans mirror the prepaid plans with a $14.99 plan that provides 250 MB of data or a $25 plan with 2 GB of data. Overages on the new postpaid plans will be charged at a rate of $10 per 1 GB of overage. This is slightly less than the prepaid plans which charge customers $25 for an additional 2 GB of usage. These new plans give customers the freedom to choose how they would like to be billed for data to be used with their shiny new 3G iPad 2.<br/><br/>As a benefit for <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/03/will-you-buy-an-ipad-2/">early adopters</a> of the iPad 2, AT&amp;T is offering a limited-time promotion that provides one free month of service for those that signup for the new $25/2 GB plan.<br/><br/>Below we have given a comparison table of iPad vs iPad 2.<br/><div><br/><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="475"

<div><br/><p id="story_continues_1">A pioneering research effort could shrink the world's most powerful supercomputer processors to the size of a sugar cube, IBM scientists say.</p><br/><em>The approach will see many computer processors stacked on top of one another, cooling them with water flowing between each one.</em><br/><br/>The aim is to reduce computers' energy use, rather than just to shrink them.<br/><br/>Some 2% of the world's total energy is consumed by building and running computer equipment.<br/><br/>Speaking at IBM's Zurich labs, Dr Bruno Michel said future computer costs would hinge on green credentials rather than speed.<br/><br/>Dr Michel and his team have already built a prototype to demonstrate the water-cooling principle. Called Aquasar, it occupies a rack larger than a refrigerator.<br/><br/>IBM estimates that Aquasar is almost 50% more energy-efficient than the world's leading supercomputers.<br/><br/>"In the past, computers were dominated by hardware costs - 50 years ago you could hold one transistor and it cost a dollar, or a franc," Dr Michel told BBC News.<br/><br/>Now when the sums are done, he said, the cost of a transistor works out to 1/100th of the price of printing a single letter on a page.<br/><br/>Now the cost of the building the next generation of supercomputers is not the problem, IBM says. The cost of running the machines is what concerns engineers.<br/><br/>"In the future, computers will be dominated by energy costs - to run a data centre will cost more than to build it," said Dr Michel.<br/><br/>The overwhelming cause of those energy costs is in cooling, because computing power generates heat as a side product.<br/><ul><br/>	<li><br/><h2><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Cube route</strong></span></h2><br/></li><br/></ul><br/>"In the past, the Top 500 list (of fastest supercomputers worldwide) was the important one; computers were listed according to their performance.<br/><div><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49903000/jpg/_49903411_49903410.jpg" alt="IBM's Aquasar supercomputer (Pic: IBM)" width="304" height="171" /></div><br/><div><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Aquasar - built on a series of water-cooled servers - is the size of a chunky refrigerator</strong></span></div><br/>"In the future, the 'Green 500' will be the important list, where computers are listed according to their efficiency."<br/><br/>Until recently, the supercomputer at the top of that list could do about 770 million computational operations per second at a cost of one watt of power.<br/><br/>The Aquasar prototype clocked up nearly half again as much, at 1.1 billion operations per second. Now the task is to shrink it.<br/><br/>"We currently have built this Aquasar system that's one rack full of processors. We plan that 10 to 15 years from now, we can collapse such a system in to one sugar cube - we're going to have a supercomputer in a sugar cube."<br/><br/>Mark Stromberg, principal research analyst at Gartner, said that the approach was a promising one.<br/><br/>But he said that tackling the finer details of cooling - to remove heat from just the right parts of the chip stacks - would take significant effort.<br/><ul><br/>	<li><br/><h2><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Third dimension</strong></span></h2><br/></li><br/></ul><br/><h2>It takes about 1,000 times more energy to move a data byte around than it does to do a computation with it once it arrives. What is more, the time taken to complete a computation is currently limited by how long it takes to do the moving.</h2><br/>Air cooling can go some way to removing this heat, which is why many desktop computers have fans inside. But a given volume of water can hold 4,000 times more waste heat than air.<br/><div><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49908000/jpg/_49908946_49903408.jpg" alt="Water-cooled Blade server" width="304" height="171" /></div><br/><div><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Aquasar system is made from green record-breaking Blade servers</strong></span></div><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>However, it adds a great deal of bulk. With current technology, a standard chip - comprising a milligram of transistors - needs 1kg of equipment to cool it, according to Dr Michel.<br/><br/>Part of the solution he and his colleagues propose - and that the large Aquasar rack demonstrates - is water cooling based on a slimmed-down, more efficient circulation of water that borrows ideas from the human body's branched circulatory system.<br/><br/>However, the engineers are exploring the third dimension first.<br/><br/>They want to stack processors one on top of another, envisioning vast stacks, each separated by water cooling channels not much more than a hair's breadth in thickness.<br/><br/>Because distance between processors both slows down and heats up the computing process, moving chips closer together in this way tackles issues of speed, size, and running costs, all at once.<br/><br/>In an effort to prove the principle the team has built stacks four processors high. But Dr Michel concedes that much work is still to be done.<br/><br/>The major technical challenge will be to engineer the connections between the different chips, which must work as conductors and be waterproof.<br/><br/>"Clearly the use of 3D processes will be a major advancement in semiconductor technology and will allow the industry to maintain its course," Gartner's Mark Stromberg told the BBC.<br/><br/>"But several challenges remain before this technology can be implemented - issues concerning thermal dissipation are among the most critical engineering challenges facing 3D semiconductor technology."<br/><br/></div><br/>&nbsp;

In the midst of a jobs crunch that has thousands of people out of work in Silicon Valley, there's a hiring frenzy going on among startups, social networking companies and some of the valley's tech giants.<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/images.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-492" title="images" src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/images.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="179" /></a><br/><br/>The <strong>Googles and Apples</strong> of the valley are competing with nimble, fast-growing social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Startups are scrambling for good hires, offering the thrill of creating something new instead of big salaries.<br/><br/>While a hiring boom may seem a contradiction when so many people are unemployed, the reality is that many of those out of work don't have the skills some of these companies are looking for.<br/><br/>"There is not even nearly enough engineers, developers and research scientists here in the Bay Area," said Greg Mikulin, co-founder of Clarity Technology Partners in Palo Alto, a staffing agency. "The motivated people who have this pedigree are all working."<br/><br/>The hiring began in earnest last fall, according to those who follow the social media and search business, and really picked up steam at the beginning of this year. It helps explain why the valley posted its first year-over job increase in 23 months on Friday, although unemployment remained unchanged at 11.2 percent.<br/><br/>Google has lost some high profile people to Facebook and is reportedly offering large retention bonuses to a few key employees while aggressively expanding its sales and engineering side. It added about 3,500 people <span style="font-size:13.3333px;">globally in the first three quarters of the year, putting pressure on smaller but fast-growing companies that are hiring from the same select pool of candidates.</span><br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>"There's definitely a war for talent between the large companies and the startups," said Tom Silver, vice president of tech job listing service <a href="http://dice.com/">Dice.com</a>.<br/><br/>Overall, tech job listings are up 38 percent nationally from last year on <a href="http://dice.com/">Dice.com</a>, Silver said, but they have jumped 64 percent in Silicon Valley.<a href="http://indeed.com/">Indeed.com</a>, which aggregates thousands of employment sites, says the leaders in the number of jobs open are Apple and Google.<br/><br/><em>Valley companies are looking for Java programmers, network engineers, network security analysts, cloud computing specialists, virtualization programmers, user interface engineers and mobile technology specialists, Silver said.</em> The average salary for these jobs in the valley is $96,299.<br/><br/>Redbeacon, which offers multiple price quotes on local services like gardening and home repair and was founded in 2008 by ex-Google employees, recently hired an in-house recruiter to "work every single day on hiring," said co-founder Ethan Anderson. "We're seeing definitely one of the most challenging recruiting environments in memory, especially in the technical area."<br/><br/>That's partly because of the rise of angel and micro-venture investing, he said, which involves individuals and small groups raising $1 million to $2 million to fund startups. "That means there are more engineers starting more companies," Anderson said. "Each will have two or three engineers, but there are hundreds of them, so that on a per-company basis there are fewer engineers available."<br/><br/>A second challenge is the sheer volume of hiring by larger companies like Google, he said. Or Cisco, for that matter, which expects to add 2,000 to 3,000 people worldwide in the next several quarters.<br/><br/>While the hiring frenzy has spawned a seller's market for top talent, it's leaving some midlevel technical workers sitting on the sidelines, Mikulin of Clarity said. With the rise of cloud computing -- the Internet-based sharing of software and information -- some desktop and support positions are disappearing, he noted. "It's some of the lower level jobs that are starting to go away, unfortunately," he said.<br/><br/>"The cloud and enterprise spaces right now are absolutely on fire," said Aaron Levie, founder of <a href="http://box.net/">Box.net</a>, an online work space information sharing company that's moving into bigger quarters this week to house a staff that's grown 70 percent this year.<br/><br/>Krish Parikh, 27, an M.I.T. grad in engineering and computer science, came to <a href="http://box.net/">Box.net</a> from Oracle a month ago. He said he has no regrets. "It's very exciting, the atmosphere is great, and there's a lot of energy. People come in early, stay late -- it's the make-it-or-break-it aspect of startups."<br/><br/>LinkedIn, an online professional network based in Mountain View, will nearly double in size this year, from 450 to 850 people, said Steve Cadigan, LinkedIn's vice president of people operations. "Reading a lot of the articles about what's happening with unemployment, I feel like I'm living in a different world here," he said.<br/><br/>While Google expands its work force, other companies lure the workers Google already has. Facebook has hired away some of Google's top talent, but the Palo Alto social networking company failed to land one person after Google offered him a six-figure bonus, according to several recruiters.<br/><br/>Google declined to comment on that story, but said its attrition is well below the industry standard, and when it has made counteroffers to employees tempted by Facebook, 70 percent decided to stay at Google.<br/><br/>Tech recruiter Robert Greene, of GreeneSearch in San Mateo, said "Google's doing what they can do to retain people. They've re-priced their options; they're paying people a lot of money to stay there. They've done a really good job of it. It is still hard for me to recruit people out of Google."<br/><br/>But "Facebook is the hottest company around," he added.<br/><br/>Jay Parikh, director of engineering at Facebook, said Facebook isn't "going after Google" and declined to comment on the hires from the Mountain View search company. "We're just trying to find the best talent."<br/><br/>"We work hard to find these people," said Parikh. "If you're hiring at Google, Facebook, Cisco or Yahoo, you face the same challenges. It's a constrained resource and the supply is lower than the demand." Facebook began the year with about 1,000 employees and is now at a little more than 1,700.<br/><br/>San Francisco game developer Zynga, which started the year with about 400 or 500 people, will reach 1,300 next week and has an additional 300 openings, said chief people officer Colleen McCreary.<br/><br/>McCreary said Zynga is attracting people from much larger, traditional software companies.<br/><br/>"Google has done a great job of building their work force," she said. But, "for people who have been there a long time, as soon as they get a reach-out from a recruiter or hear from their friends, 'I'm doing this neat thing,' they get interested."<br/><br/>&nbsp;
