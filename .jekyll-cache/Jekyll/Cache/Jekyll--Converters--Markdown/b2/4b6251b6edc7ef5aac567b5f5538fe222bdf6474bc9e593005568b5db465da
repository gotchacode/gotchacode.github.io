I"Æ<p>Hey folks! It has been pretty damn long sine I last wrote on this blog. Well, I  am writing this watching Mr. Robot Season 1 for the 2/3 time. I really like most of this series except it gets really dark and too sci-fi sometimes.</p>

<p>I bought a mechanical keyboard last month and it has been amazing. Shame, I canâ€™t use it in office.</p>

<p>Also, if you have noticed, the blog is running on the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper">white paper</a> and it looks much better and cleaner than before.</p>

<p>I have again started using Vim more often at work after a long hiatus. I will probably write some more blogs these days.</p>

<p>Until next time, Ciao! ðŸš€</p>
