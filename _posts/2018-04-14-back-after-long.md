Hey folks! It has been pretty damn long sine I last wrote on this blog. Well, I  am writing this watching Mr. Robot Season 1 for the 2/3 time. I really like most of this series except it gets really dark and too sci-fi sometimes.

I bought a mechanical keyboard last month and it has been amazing. Shame, I can't use it in office.

Also, if you have noticed, the blog is running on the latest version of [white paper](https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper) and it looks much better and cleaner than before.

I have again started using Vim more often at work after a long hiatus. I will probably write some more blogs these days.

Until next time, Ciao! ðŸš€
