But, I have some interesting stuff for you guys.<br /><br />Development is a complex process and it requires a lot of skill,&nbsp;hard work&nbsp;and techniques to be a really good developer. Recently, I &nbsp;came across a lot of good stuff and things are improving for me quite positively. I wanted to share the same with you.<br /><br />These are mostly talks, videos or presentation by some really popular, successful people from our industry. The tips they give are mostly an eye opener. Hope you enjoy them.<br /><br /><script async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="505376778282a900020560da" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script> Also, here is another great presentation by the same guy.  <script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="d3f56f007adf01307e7722000a9f0395" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><br /><br />The next talk is by Heroku co-founder Adam.
