There is one thing that is very noticeable about Google+ and that is the way it is evolving. When it first came in it had nothing very special so as to take Social Networking giant Facebook . But recently some very cool and clean looking features has been incorporated into Google+.<br/><br/>In the first screenshot you can see that there is a new navigation UI in Google+, just click the Google+ logo and you will get all the options such a profile page, Search, Images, Maps, Youtube, News, Gmail,Documents etc.<br/><br/>It might prove a very decisive move from Google+ to incorporate all the existing services that are being used by millions into Social Networking realm.The switch seems perfectly clean and everything works like wonders.<br/><br/>[caption id="attachment_568" align="alignleft" width="580" caption="New Way To Navigate in Google+"]<a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/pic.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-568" title="pic" src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/pic.png" alt="" width="580" height="326" /></a>[/caption]<br/><br/>Also in the next one we can see that a very portable YouTube player incorporated in the right, Just search in your favorite artist/band and it will be lined up in a convenient playlist.
