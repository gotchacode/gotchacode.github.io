This is the first self-help guide to configure your web server in an Ubuntu/fedora. Only the very basic and initial server config will be dealt in this post.Subsequent post will have the advanced stuffs.<br/><br/>First inorder to configure your system to act as a web-server, the best and most favourable thing u can do is that you install the server installation repos initially.If you are installing fedora from a dvd, they give you four options and you should select the server option.So that your OS is already optimized to be a server.And don’t worry it will be having all the stuff you need in a graphical desktop.<br/><br/>Here are the steps you need to follow once you are connected to an internet connection with decent speed.<br/><br/>Any server in Linux is based on LAMP.<br/><br/>Its works as good as any xampp server you have used in Windows.Though you need to have some basic understanding of permissions in Linux.<br/><br/>To install MySQL5, you need to do this:<br/>yum install mysql mysql-server<br/><br/>Then we create the system startup links for MySQL (so that MySQL starts automatically whenever the system boots) and start the MySQL server:<br/><br/>chkconfig --levels 235 mysqld on<br/><br/><br/>/etc/init.d/mysqld start<br/>Run<br/>mysql_secure_installation<br/>to set a password for the user root (otherwise anybody can access your MySQL database!):<br/>[root@server1~]# mysql_secure_installation<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MySQL<br/><br/>SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE! PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current<br/><br/>password for the root user. If you've just installed MySQL, and<br/><br/>you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,<br/><br/>so you should just press enter here.<br/><br/>Enter current password for root (enter for none): &lt;-- ENTER<br/><br/>OK, successfully used password, moving on...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL<br/><br/>root user without the proper authorisation.<br/><br/><br/>Set root password? [Y/n] &lt;-- ENTER<br/><br/>New password: &lt;-- yourrootsqlpassword<br/><br/>Re-enter new password: &lt;-- yourrootsqlpassword<br/><br/>Password updated successfully!<br/><br/>Reloading privilege tables..<br/><br/>... Success!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone<br/><br/><br/>to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for<br/><br/>them. This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation<br/><br/>go a bit smoother. You should remove them before moving into a<br/><br/>production environment.<br/><br/>Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] &lt;-- ENTER<br/><br/>... Success!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'. This<br/><br/>ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.<br/><br/><br/>Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] &lt;-- ENTER<br/><br/>... Success!<br/><br/><br/><br/>By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can<br/><br/><br/>access. This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed<br/><br/>before moving into a production environment.<br/><br/><br/>Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] &lt;-- ENTER<br/><br/>- Dropping test database...<br/><br/>... Success!<br/><br/><br/>- Removing privileges on test database...<br/><br/>...
