Books are said to be the most faithful friends. We all reading different kinds of books. This tendency has been digitized when books evolve into digital media equivalent – E-Books.  Now a days, more and more people are realizing the ease and comfort offered by ebooks vs traditional paper books. E-books are fast to download, easy to read and a lot of classics are free to download at sites like  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Gutenberg.com</a> and <a href="http://www.scribd.com.">Scribd.com</a><br/>You probably know the strain of watching and reading your computer monitor for long periods of time. It is in fact harmful for our eyes to stare at a traditional TFT or LCD monitor for long periods of time. Thus comes the roles of e-book readers based on E-Ink.  E-Ink is a revolutionary technology of electronic paper display developed by E-Ink Corporation. It gives the user comfortable reading experience with minimal strain on the reader&#8217;s eyes and real paper feeling. The E-Ink technology is used in Amazon Kindle, the Indian ebook readers Infibeam Pi and the recently released Infibeam Pi2.<br/><br/>Many of you might be considering to buy one of these ebook readers for ease, portability and the great experience of reading with E-Ink. Well , I am here to help you give an overview of the best EBook readers currently in market.  I am going to compare two ebook readers well known to Indian readers : The Amazon Kindle 3 and The Infibeam Pi and the recently released Infibeam Pi2.

<div><br/><p id="story_continues_1">A pioneering research effort could shrink the world&#8217;s most powerful supercomputer processors to the size of a sugar cube, IBM scientists say.</p><br/><em>The approach will see many computer processors stacked on top of one another, cooling them with water flowing between each one.</em><br/><br/>The aim is to reduce computers&#8217; energy use, rather than just to shrink them.<br/><br/>Some 2% of the world&#8217;s total energy is consumed by building and running computer equipment.<br/><br/>Speaking at IBM&#8217;s Zurich labs, Dr Bruno Michel said future computer costs would hinge on green credentials rather than speed.<br/><br/>Dr Michel and his team have already built a prototype to demonstrate the water-cooling principle. Called Aquasar, it occupies a rack larger than a refrigerator.<br/><br/>IBM estimates that Aquasar is almost 50% more energy-efficient than the world&#8217;s leading supercomputers.<br/><br/>&#8220;In the past, computers were dominated by hardware costs - 50 years ago you could hold one transistor and it cost a dollar, or a franc,&#8221; Dr Michel told BBC News.<br/><br/>Now when the sums are done, he said, the cost of a transistor works out to 1/100th of the price of printing a single letter on a page.<br/><br/>Now the cost of the building the next generation of supercomputers is not the problem, IBM says. The cost of running the machines is what concerns engineers.<br/><br/>&#8220;In the future, computers will be dominated by energy costs - to run a data centre will cost more than to build it,&#8221; said Dr Michel.<br/><br/>The overwhelming cause of those energy costs is in cooling, because computing power generates heat as a side product.<br/><ul><br/>	<li><br/><h2><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Cube route</strong></span></h2><br/></li><br/></ul><br/>&#8220;In the past, the Top 500 list (of fastest supercomputers worldwide) was the important one; computers were listed according to their performance.<br/><div><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49903000/jpg/_49903411_49903410.jpg" alt="IBM's Aquasar supercomputer (Pic: IBM)" width="304" height="171" /></div><br/><div><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Aquasar - built on a series of water-cooled servers - is the size of a chunky refrigerator</strong></span></div><br/>&#8220;In the future, the &#8216;Green 500&#8217; will be the important list, where computers are listed according to their efficiency.&#8221;<br/><br/>Until recently, the supercomputer at the top of that list could do about 770 million computational operations per second at a cost of one watt of power.<br/><br/>The Aquasar prototype clocked up nearly half again as much, at 1.1 billion operations per second. Now the task is to shrink it.<br/><br/>&#8220;We currently have built this Aquasar system that&#8217;s one rack full of processors. We plan that 10 to 15 years from now, we can collapse such a system in to one sugar cube - we&#8217;re going to have a supercomputer in a sugar cube.&#8221;<br/><br/>Mark Stromberg, principal research analyst at Gartner, said that the approach was a promising one.<br/><br/>But he said that tackling the finer details of cooling - to remove heat from just the right parts of the chip stacks - would take significant effort.<br/><ul><br/>	<li><br/><h2><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Third dimension</strong></span></h2><br/></li><br/></ul><br/><h2>It takes about 1,000 times more energy to move a data byte around than it does to do a computation with it once it arrives. What is more, the time taken to complete a computation is currently limited by how long it takes to do the moving.</h2><br/>Air cooling can go some way to removing this heat, which is why many desktop computers have fans inside. But a given volume of water can hold 4,000 times more waste heat than air.<br/><div><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49908000/jpg/_49908946_49903408.jpg" alt="Water-cooled Blade server" width="304" height="171" /></div><br/><div><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Aquasar system is made from green record-breaking Blade servers</strong></span></div><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>However, it adds a great deal of bulk. With current technology, a standard chip - comprising a milligram of transistors - needs 1kg of equipment to cool it, according to Dr Michel.<br/><br/>Part of the solution he and his colleagues propose - and that the large Aquasar rack demonstrates - is water cooling based on a slimmed-down, more efficient circulation of water that borrows ideas from the human body&#8217;s branched circulatory system.<br/><br/>However, the engineers are exploring the third dimension first.<br/><br/>They want to stack processors one on top of another, envisioning vast stacks, each separated by water cooling channels not much more than a hair&#8217;s breadth in thickness.<br/><br/>Because distance between processors both slows down and heats up the computing process, moving chips closer together in this way tackles issues of speed, size, and running costs, all at once.<br/><br/>In an effort to prove the principle the team has built stacks four processors high. But Dr Michel concedes that much work is still to be done.<br/><br/>The major technical challenge will be to engineer the connections between the different chips, which must work as conductors and be waterproof.<br/><br/>&#8220;Clearly the use of 3D processes will be a major advancement in semiconductor technology and will allow the industry to maintain its course,&#8221; Gartner&#8217;s Mark Stromberg told the BBC.<br/><br/>&#8220;But several challenges remain before this technology can be implemented - issues concerning thermal dissipation are among the most critical engineering challenges facing 3D semiconductor technology.&#8221;<br/><br/></div><br/>&nbsp;

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
In the midst of a jobs crunch that has thousands of people out of work in Silicon Valley, there&#8217;s a hiring frenzy going on among startups, social networking companies and some of the valley&#8217;s tech giants.<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/images.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-492" title="images" src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/images.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="179" /></a><br/><br/>The <strong>Googles and Apples</strong> of the valley are competing with nimble, fast-growing social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Startups are scrambling for good hires, offering the thrill of creating something new instead of big salaries.<br/><br/>While a hiring boom may seem a contradiction when so many people are unemployed, the reality is that many of those out of work don&#8217;t have the skills some of these companies are looking for.<br/><br/>&#8220;There is not even nearly enough engineers, developers and research scientists here in the Bay Area,&#8221; said Greg Mikulin, co-founder of Clarity Technology Partners in Palo Alto, a staffing agency. &#8220;The motivated people who have this pedigree are all working.&#8221;<br/><br/>The hiring began in earnest last fall, according to those who follow the social media and search business, and really picked up steam at the beginning of this year. It helps explain why the valley posted its first year-over job increase in 23 months on Friday, although unemployment remained unchanged at 11.2 percent.<br/><br/>Google has lost some high profile people to Facebook and is reportedly offering large retention bonuses to a few key employees while aggressively expanding its sales and engineering side. It added about 3,500 people <span style="font-size:13.3333px;">globally in the first three quarters of the year, putting pressure on smaller but fast-growing companies that are hiring from the same select pool of candidates.</span><br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>&#8220;There&#8217;s definitely a war for talent between the large companies and the startups,&#8221; said Tom Silver, vice president of tech job listing service <a href="http://dice.com/">Dice.com</a>.<br/><br/>Overall, tech job listings are up 38 percent nationally from last year on <a href="http://dice.com/">Dice.com</a>, Silver said, but they have jumped 64 percent in Silicon Valley.<a href="http://indeed.com/">Indeed.com</a>, which aggregates thousands of employment sites, says the leaders in the number of jobs open are Apple and Google.<br/><br/><em>Valley companies are looking for Java programmers, network engineers, network security analysts, cloud computing specialists, virtualization programmers, user interface engineers and mobile technology specialists, Silver said.</em> The average salary for these jobs in the valley is $96,299.<br/><br/>Redbeacon, which offers multiple price quotes on local services like gardening and home repair and was founded in 2008 by ex-Google employees, recently hired an in-house recruiter to &#8220;work every single day on hiring,&#8221; said co-founder Ethan Anderson. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing definitely one of the most challenging recruiting environments in memory, especially in the technical area.&#8221;<br/><br/>That&#8217;s partly because of the rise of angel and micro-venture investing, he said, which involves individuals and small groups raising $1 million to $2 million to fund startups. &#8220;That means there are more engineers starting more companies,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;Each will have two or three engineers, but there are hundreds of them, so that on a per-company basis there are fewer engineers available.&#8221;<br/><br/>A second challenge is the sheer volume of hiring by larger companies like Google, he said. Or Cisco, for that matter, which expects to add 2,000 to 3,000 people worldwide in the next several quarters.<br/><br/>While the hiring frenzy has spawned a seller&#8217;s market for top talent, it&#8217;s leaving some midlevel technical workers sitting on the sidelines, Mikulin of Clarity said. With the rise of cloud computing &#8211; the Internet-based sharing of software and information &#8211; some desktop and support positions are disappearing, he noted. &#8220;It&#8217;s some of the lower level jobs that are starting to go away, unfortunately,&#8221; he said.<br/><br/>&#8220;The cloud and enterprise spaces right now are absolutely on fire,&#8221; said Aaron Levie, founder of <a href="http://box.net/">Box.net</a>, an online work space information sharing company that&#8217;s moving into bigger quarters this week to house a staff that&#8217;s grown 70 percent this year.<br/><br/>Krish Parikh, 27, an M.I.T. grad in engineering and computer science, came to <a href="http://box.net/">Box.net</a> from Oracle a month ago. He said he has no regrets. &#8220;It&#8217;s very exciting, the atmosphere is great, and there&#8217;s a lot of energy. People come in early, stay late &#8211; it&#8217;s the make-it-or-break-it aspect of startups.&#8221;<br/><br/>LinkedIn, an online professional network based in Mountain View, will nearly double in size this year, from 450 to 850 people, said Steve Cadigan, LinkedIn&#8217;s vice president of people operations. &#8220;Reading a lot of the articles about what&#8217;s happening with unemployment, I feel like I&#8217;m living in a different world here,&#8221; he said.<br/><br/>While Google expands its work force, other companies lure the workers Google already has. Facebook has hired away some of Google&#8217;s top talent, but the Palo Alto social networking company failed to land one person after Google offered him a six-figure bonus, according to several recruiters.<br/><br/>Google declined to comment on that story, but said its attrition is well below the industry standard, and when it has made counteroffers to employees tempted by Facebook, 70 percent decided to stay at Google.<br/><br/>Tech recruiter Robert Greene, of GreeneSearch in San Mateo, said &#8220;Google&#8217;s doing what they can do to retain people. They&#8217;ve re-priced their options; they&#8217;re paying people a lot of money to stay there. They&#8217;ve done a really good job of it. It is still hard for me to recruit people out of Google.&#8221;<br/><br/>But &#8220;Facebook is the hottest company around,&#8221; he added.<br/><br/>Jay Parikh, director of engineering at Facebook, said Facebook isn&#8217;t &#8220;going after Google&#8221; and declined to comment on the hires from the Mountain View search company. &#8220;We&#8217;re just trying to find the best talent.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;We work hard to find these people,&#8221; said Parikh. &#8220;If you&#8217;re hiring at Google, Facebook, Cisco or Yahoo, you face the same challenges. It&#8217;s a constrained resource and the supply is lower than the demand.&#8221; Facebook began the year with about 1,000 employees and is now at a little more than 1,700.<br/><br/>San Francisco game developer Zynga, which started the year with about 400 or 500 people, will reach 1,300 next week and has an additional 300 openings, said chief people officer Colleen McCreary.<br/><br/>McCreary said Zynga is attracting people from much larger, traditional software companies.<br/><br/>&#8220;Google has done a great job of building their work force,&#8221; she said. But, &#8220;for people who have been there a long time, as soon as they get a reach-out from a recruiter or hear from their friends, &#8216;I&#8217;m doing this neat thing,&#8217; they get interested.&#8221;<br/><br/>&nbsp;

<em><strong>Web servers that store data locally save time on database searches but sometimes serve up obsolete results. A new system solves that problem.</strong></em><br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><em>[gallery]<br/><br/>Today, visiting almost any major website — checking your Facebook news feed, looking for books on Amazon, bidding for merchandise on eBay — involves querying a database. But the databases that these sites maintain are enormous, and searching them anew every time a new user logs on would be painfully time consuming. To serve up data in a timely fashion, most big sites use a technique called caching. Their servers keep local copies of their most frequently accessed data, which they can send to users without searching the database.<br/><br/>But caching has an obvious problem: If any of the data in the database changes, the cached copies have to change too; moreover, any cached data that are in any way dependent on the changed data also have to change. Tracking such data dependencies is a nightmare for programmers, but even when they do their jobs well, problems can arise. For instance, says Dan Ports, a graduate student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, suppose that someone is bidding on an item on eBay. The names of the bidders could be cached in one place, the value of their bids in another. Making a new bid updates the database, but as that update propagates through the network of servers, it could reach the value cache before it reaches the name cache. The bidder would see someone else’s name next to her bid and think she’d been beaten to the punch. “They might see their own bid attributed to somebody else,” Ports says, “and wind up in a bidding war with themselves.”<br/><br/>MIT researchers have developed a new caching system that eliminates this type of asymmetric data retrieval while also making database caches much easier to program. Led by Ports and his thesis advisor, Institute Professor Barbara Liskov, who won the 2008 Turing Award, the highest award in computer science, the research also involves associate professor Sam Madden, PhD student Austin Clements, and former master’s student Irene Zhang. Ports presented <a href="http://drkp.net/drkp/papers/txcache-osdi10.pdf" target="_blank">the system</a> on Oct. 5 at the USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation in Vancouver.<br/><br/><strong>Transact locally</strong><br/><br/>Unlike existing database caching systems, Ports and Liskov’s can handle what computer scientists call transactions. A transaction is a set of computations that are treated as a block: None of them will be performed unless all of them are performed. “Suppose that you’re making a plane reservation, and it has two legs,” says Liskov. “You’re not interested in getting one of them and not the other. If you run this as a transaction, then the underlying system will guarantee that you get either both of them or neither of them. And it does this regardless of whether there are other concurrent accesses, or other users are trying to get seats on those flights, or there are machine failures, and so forth. Transactions are a well-understood technique in computer science to achieve this kind of functionality.” Indeed, it’s the idea of transactions that gives the new system its name: TxCache, where “Tx” is a shorthand for “transaction.”<br/><br/>TxCache also makes it easier for programmers to manage caches. “Existing caches have the approach that they just make this cache and tell the programmer, ‘Here’s a cache: You can put stuff in it if you want; you can get stuff out of it if you want,’” says Ports. “But figuring out how to do that is entirely up to you.” TxCache, however, recognizes that a computer program already implicitly defines the relationships between stored data. For instance, a line of code might say that Z = X + Y, which is an instruction to look up X, look up Y, and store their sum as Z. With TxCache, the programmer would simply specify that that line of code — Z = X + Y — should be cached, and the system would automatically ensure that, whenever any one of those variables changed, the cached copies of the other two would be updated, everywhere. And, of course, it can perform the same type of maintenance with more complicated data dependencies, represented by more complicated functions.<br/><br/><strong>Bean counting</strong><br/><br/>According to Liskov, the key to getting TxCache to work was “a lot of bookkeeping.” The system has to track what data are cached where, and which data depend on each other. Indeed, Liskov says, it was the fear that that bookkeeping would chew up too many computing cycles that dissuaded the designers of existing caching systems from supporting transactions. But, she explains, updating the caches is necessary only when data in the database change. Modifying the data is a labor-intensive operation; the bookkeeping steps are comparatively simple. “Yes, we are doing more work, but proportionally it’s very small,” Liskov says. “It’s on the order of 5 to 7 percent.” In the researchers’ experiments, websites were more than five times as fast when running TxCache as they were without it.<br/><br/>“The trouble with large-scale services like Bing and Amazon and Google and the like is that they operate at such a high level of scalability,” says Solom Heddaya, a partner at Microsoft and infrastructure architect for Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. “On a single request from the user searching for something, there are many, many applications that get invoked in real time, and they together will use tens of thousands of servers.” On that scale, Heddaya says, some kind of caching system is necessary. But, he says, “until this paper came along, people building these systems said, ‘Hey, we will shift the burden to the programmer of the application. We will give you the convenience of caching, so that we bring the data closer to where the computation is, but we will make you worry about whether the cache has the right data.”<br/><br/>Heddaya cautions that, unlike some other caching systems, the MIT researchers’ offers significant performance improvements only for sites where reading operations — looking up data in the database — greatly outnumber writing operations — updating data in the databases. But according to Ports, “Adding support for using caching during read/write transactions is one of the things we&#8217;re thinking about now. There aren&#8217;t any major technical obstacles to doing so: It&#8217;s mainly a question of how we can do so without introducing unexpected effects that make life more difficult for users and programmers.”<br/><strong><br/></strong></em>

<a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/nokia-e7-5401.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-477" title="Nokia-E7-540" src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/nokia-e7-5401.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="346" /></a><br/><br/>Nokia expands Symbian^3 family with Nokia E7, Nokia C6-01 and Nokia C7.<br/><br/>Symbian^3 family of devices is growing with the announcement of three new products across Cseries and Eseries. Joining the Symbian^3 based Nokia N8 are the all new touchscreen and QWERTY business device, the Nokia E7, a compact touchscreen C6 and the sleek touchscreen Nokia C7.<br/><br/>FEATURES OF NOKIA E7:<br/><br/>1.Billed as the ultimate business smartphone, the Nokia E7 boasts Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync support alongside a luscious 4-inch touchscreen display, which uses Nokia’s ClearBlack technology for improved outdoor visibility.<br/><br/>2.The Nokia E7 also comes with a slide out four-row QWERTY keyboard making it the ideal mobile business device. Despite the addition of a full keyboard, the E7 is only a smidge deeper than the Nokia N8 at 13.6mm thin.<br/><br/>3. The device also boasts an 8-megapixel snapper and comes complete with 16GB of on-board storage.<br/><br/>4..As a business device, the Nokia E7 comes sporting a raft of security features including business grade device lock and wipe functionality, secure intranet access and remote device management.<br/><br/>5. These come alongside its connectivity and productivity prowess, with support for Mail for Exchange, Microsoft Communicator Mobile and Microsoft Share Point Server.<br/><br/>6. Business folk on the move will also benefit from free walk and drive navigation thanks to Ovi Maps including premium guides from the likes of Lonely Planet and Via Michelin.<br/><br/>7.Like the Nokia N8, the Nokia E7 also boasts an HDMI connection and Dolby Digital Plus Surround Sound. With the 8-megapixel camera, users will be able to shoot and edit HD quality images (including 720p video) and sound.<br/><br/>8. As a Symbian^3 device, users can customise up to three homescreens and get live updates from the likes of Facebook and Twitter live on their homescreens.<br/><br/>9.Those on the move will welcome the Nokia E7′s travel-friendly 18 days of standby time and up to 9 hours of talktime. The device, which will be available in dark grey, silver white, green, blue and orange will be available in the last quarter of 2010 and is expected to retail for €495 before taxes and subsidies.<br/><br/>Joining the Nokia E7 and Nokia N8 as part of the Symbian^3 family are the all-new Nokia C6 and Nokia C7. Both of these devices raise the bar for design and social networking amongst their already good-looking Cseries brethren. Homescreen access to the latest updates from your favourite social networks are offered on tap for both devices.<br/><br/>First in the new Cseries lineup is the sleek C7 which boasts a 3.5-inch AMOLED display and is a hand-friendly 10.5mm thin. Like the E7 this device also sports an 8-megapixel camera with 8GB of onboard storage (expandable to 40GB with microSD).<br/><br/>The Nokia C7 will also shoot HD video in 720p and comes with free global walk and drive navigation and a digital compass. City users will welcome the active noise cancellation for clearer voice calls whilst the battery will keep calls going for up to 9.5 hours (in GSM mode) and stay on standby for an astounding 27 days (3G mode). The Nokia C7 is expected to go on sale before the end of 2010 and will be available in black, metal or brown for an estimated retail price of €335 before taxes and subsidies&#8230;..<br/><br/><a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/home-screens-themes-small.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-478" title="look of new symbian " src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/home-screens-themes-small.png" alt="" width="368" height="300" /></a><br/><br/>The Symbian^3 family of products grow to four, all to be available before the end 2010. This latest version of Symbian is packing 250 new features and improvements whilst remaining familiar to the millions of existing Symbian users worldwide. With multiple homescreen support, multitasking and gesture-based interactions, this latest version of Symbian^3 is a big leap forward.<br/><br/>We’re excited to see the Symbian^3 family of devices come to life and we can’t wait to get our hands on them after the keynotes have finished. Stay tuned for more later, meanwhile let us know what you think in the comments below
