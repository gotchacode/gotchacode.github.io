Though Google+ appeared late on social networking scene but they are doing it pretty nicely. While it may not be biggest social network of the planet, but if you are looking for sensible and informative discussions it is the place you should be.<br /><br />Also, if you are a developer/programmer it is a very helpful to get help from fellow geeks in these communities. Also spam is almost negligible as mostly sensible(fewer in number) use it. You can view it as an excellent replacement to the Stackoverflow which might be little harsh on the newbies.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nYj_vg8KRQI/UNNZP2OBouI/AAAAAAAAA5w/PK66_gA0_CQ/s1600/googlelplus1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="148" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nYj_vg8KRQI/UNNZP2OBouI/AAAAAAAAA5w/PK66_gA0_CQ/s320/googlelplus1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />So i would suggest to join the communities which matches your interest. It would definitely give a great opportunity to connect, discuss&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;ideas and share knowledge.<br /><br /><br /></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Here are some tips for optimizing Google Chrome Extensions:<br /><br />One should check these things at first,<br /><br />Open the Chrome task manager and check CPU and RAM usage for your extension. Also check how this value changes for your extensions after full day of Chrome run. If RAM usage &gt; 15mb it must be a serious reason not to release it without optimizations. Also if CPU value above zero on a persistence basis is bad sign too.<br /><br />Also closure compiler can help your code execute faster. &nbsp;If your have identified that the execution of code is more of an issue than the potential of&nbsp;maximizing&nbsp;the speed of your end points. Also if you are dealing with facebook API , working through bulks calls to Facebook and catching that locally seems to improve performance. Another important thing to note is that if you are concerned with speed or delay tour user experiences, then UI design is a great place to start. The&nbsp;perceived speed of an application can be significantly altered just be settings expectations&nbsp;appropriately, with regard to the speed with which a particular process will execute. So tell users it will take 10 secs when it takes 8 secs.<br /><br />This post is based on a question i asked on Chrome Extension group, you can check out the thread <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/chromium-extensions/jNNksFBpa3A/discussion" target="_blank">here</a>. Since these tips are quite handy i thought of sharing them in here in form of a blog post. Hope this helps!<br /><br /><br /></div>

Get it working before you optimize it.</li> <li>Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”.</li> <li>Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.</li></ul></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">This one is actually a task in a level in password guessing game , well I thought the problem was interesting so i am blogging about it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><script src="https://raw.github.com/moski/gist-Blogger/master/public/gistLoader.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Here is the <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/1159709/" target="_blank">data dump&nbsp;</a>. As you can see that there are more than 1000 lines of data and our password is one of them. The only hint is that the password occurs just once.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Well here is how i cracked this problem. First of all if our password occurs just once, so we should better get all the unique&nbsp;occurrences of the data.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">So i used the uniq utility in unix like systems that got a reduced <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/1159711/" target="_blank">data dump</a>. As you can see now the data is reduced to just 102 lines.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Now the approach is to find and output the password i.e the word&nbsp;occurring just once in the dump. For that it will take each word from the reduced dump at a time and get the count of its occurrence. Once we &nbsp;find the one with single occurrence, it will be directed to output.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Here is the python code required to do this job for it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="gistLoad" data-id="3631329" id="gist-3631329">Loading &#8230;.</div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">A lot of recent posts on Hacker News suggest that Linux is dead on Desktop and OS X killed it. Well I don&#8217;t think that it is still dead or it will be ever.<br />Instead of Lamenting on it, we should learn from our mistakes and also from success of OS X. Here are some of things we could do:<br /><br /><b>User Interface</b>: This is one place where OS X beats Linux by huge margin, Apple hire the best graphic designers and they put a lot of effort on how it looks and how&nbsp;intuitive is feels. Linux really need to improve on the UI specially we need excellent graphic designers that can create the next gen graphics. We could also take a lesson from Androids, they look awesome and they have a Linux at the core. The problem of fragmentation can be get rid with a unified great looking Desktop Environment that is functional as well as beautiful. We could always have the choice of other DE, but there should be one that could cater of masses of people who just want there OS to work and don&#8217;t have the technical aptitude to tweak it.<br /><br /><b>Softwares</b>: This is one place where we have a lead. The only problem is that we don&#8217;t have as much third party developers developing for Linux. One way to fix that is that we could have a central Software center that could provides softwares for almost all the Linux Distributions. Package management system could be merged into one or we could have a same package management in addition to the other package manager specific to that distro.<br /><br /><br /><b>Stability</b>: This is one thing that really needs to be addressed very seriously. No user wants his OS to crash performing an update or release upgrade. These issues should be addressed from the smallest level and only stable kernels should be included. Also advanced filesystem such as ZFS or BRFTS should be included as soon as possible such that we do fast backups and full system rollback.<br /><br /><b>Focus on Developers</b>: OS X earned a huge advantage because it focused on developers and provided everything they need on a very stable environment. We need to beat them in that. We have all the tools , we just need to make it more organized and less painful. Any new release should make it their first priority to see that setting a &nbsp;development environment is as easy as clicking a button on software center or by a unified command that fetches all dependencies. They could be grouped as say Rails Development, Python Development, PHP Development. Surely we can trim these unified packages if we need. But a developer not used to Linux would like to start with his development as soon as possible without learning to mess with the Operating system.&#8221;<b><i>Just Works</i></b>&#8221; is a important factor that we need to focus on<i>.<b>It is very crucial because these are the developer who will build third party apps and availability of these apps could only attract masses to adopt Linux.</b></i><br /><i><b><br /></b></i>We need to play on our strengths rather than trying to imitate Apple. They have their limits, We have freedom to choose, We can offer our OS for free, They can&#8217;t. We can give away open source softwares for free, They cant do that.With the other Hardware manufactures catching up soon, Apple won&#8217;t have a next gen leap with their hardware. Android devices have already proved it is possible.<br /><i><b><br /></b></i><i style="font-weight: bold;">Imagine an OS with a UI better than Macs, and free softwares in vast Apt Repositories(just an example..don&#8217;t kill me for it). Stability and full drivers support. This could be </i><b>Linux </b><b><i>that could really be the </i>Desktop of the Year.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b><b>P.S Everyone who hates these ideas are welcome to suggest better ones, i am just suggesting ideas and I am sure there are better ones.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><br /><br /></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Github is easily the world&#8217;s largest repository for projects with almost all major companies as well as Startups &nbsp;use them to deploy their code or contribute to Open Source.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is a small infographic of Top 10 Languages that are used to create projects at Github.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HJeXwmNDfoo/UELkbL4YMHI/AAAAAAAAA1k/x6851ZQ7k_0/s1600/screen5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="195" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HJeXwmNDfoo/UELkbL4YMHI/AAAAAAAAA1k/x6851ZQ7k_0/s400/screen5.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;I will try to analyze what we can deduce from this data.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">JavaScript, Ruby and Python take first three places. It was quite obvious because Developers are more focused to develop stuff for web and these languages provide everything you need to create a great looking website or App that can scale. Node , Rails and Django are the most famous projects that are trending nowadays.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">One shocker is Shell Beating Java and PHP, well all we can make out from this data is that most of people or a huge percentage using Github are *nix users (either OS X or Linux ) . One factor can also be that people might not want to Open Source there java projects or PHP ones.Its a highly competitive market and sure we can&#8217;t blame them.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Next up we have C, C++ , Perl and Objective-C. It was obvious because C and C++ are tougher to learn compared to languages such as python, Ruby or JavaScript.Objective-C in the list shows that iOS developers are also contributing to Open Source projects at Github.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This data might not be accurate to the developers language choice and Projects, but surely gives us a view of what current trend is.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It is a famous quote from an artwork at Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s workplace. Well this post has nothing to do with Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg.<br />Rather this article will give you some cool hacks/tips on how you can optimize or build your development setup.<br /><br />The important factors hardware, software, Language and services are mentioned here:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Hardware: Choose a hardware that gives you least trouble to setup, if possible always have a secondary screen while using &nbsp;a netbook/laptop. More screen real estate is always handy. Use SSD in place of normal SATA hard drive. You will be amazed by how much faster your system will behave.Don&#8217;t compromise on RAM, the more the memory the better it is. Another important thing is that&nbsp;<u>Never mix your development machine with your desktop machine</u>. You will have less distraction and much better result.I would suggest building your own machine as it will give your more freedom and will save your precious money that you can invest in other gears. If you are inclined to develop on Linux shy away from nvidia graphics. ATI gives fewer problems.A Noise cancelling headphone and a ergonomic keyboard are also a valuable addition.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Software: If you want a fairly current and stable development environment I would suggest you use something like Ubuntu or Debian as your development OS. They are pretty mainstream, have the largest repository in planet, anything that will be introduced to Linux will reach your pretty soon. Also the biggest benefit is that you won&#8217;t have to waste countless hours to configure it. Fedora/Arch/Gentoo is good to learn Linux but they take pretty huge amount of time to configure. And if u are a developer who is past that stage probably you won&#8217;t like to get in that mess. Some may argue about an OS X as a choice of development platform. I would not&nbsp;hesitate&nbsp;to say that it can be an excellent choice given the hardware and operating system is of world class. Also if you developing apps for iOS or OS X you should stick to Apple Ecosystem. The only thing that can bug you is that you can get every development&nbsp;environment free in Ubuntu/Debian for which you might need to loose some money to buy stuff from App Store.One more important thing is that you should invest sometime to learn some very important utilities on a&nbsp;UNIX&nbsp;platform like basic shell scripting, some command line and get&nbsp;acquainted&nbsp;with &nbsp;Vim/Emacs and tmux or screen. Once you master these things it will give a a huge advantage and you will be able to do more efficient&nbsp;development.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Language : Its purely &nbsp;a matter of choice but having a scripting language such as perl, ruby or python and a low level language such as C will give u a great deal of advantage.Also if you are a web-based guy do learn ruby,&nbsp;JavaScript, CSS.Plus some server side knowledge will always be useful to you.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Services: Always try to follow and use mainstream and proven services such that you will have greater acceptance.eg: Github. Also blog about your work and subscribe to a mailing list. It will always keep you informed and current.</li></ul><div>In the end, you should always prefer a test driven, well documented clean code such that it will be easier to integrate or spawn newer functionality in your product.</div></div>
