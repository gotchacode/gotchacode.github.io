<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">In Software development, there are so many things to learn. Especially, if you are web developer there are so many things to learn. Should you learn Rails, Django or .NET? Or should you learn Angular, Backbone or Ember?<br /><br />It is a very tricky question and has been puzzling me for quite sometime. But some time back, it kind of dawned on me that I should just try and own one technology at one time. Say if it's Django try and learn everything about Django. Become the best in your company at Django. The benefits are two fold:<br />- You will have a stable career and you will be happy with the quality of your work.<br />- You can use that understanding of that technology with understanding and learning other technologies really fast.<br /><br />Another problem that I sometime face is lack of motivation to learn if something gets really tough. I learned that instead of setting a super tough goal, I should rather split it up and own it one by one. First of all, it gives me a sense of achievement and confidence. Also, my whole effort would be on completing that goal with best of my abilities.<br /><br />The things I said above is not rocket science, but if you are at my stage of learning. It might be useful to you.<br /><br /><br />With that said, May the Force be with you!<br /><br /><pre><span style="color: lime;">                ____                  <br />                _.' :  `._               <br />            .-.'`.  ;   .'`.-.           <br />   __      / : ___\ ;  /___ ; \      __  <br /> ,'_ ""--.:__;".-.";: :".-.":__;.--"" _`,<br /> :' `.t""--..

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Macs are beautiful machine. Luckily, I own a Macbook Pro that has 8GB ram and 256GB SSD. I am a Web Developer by profession so here are some tips that you could use to setup your mac.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UGabibWAlr8/USpTz8VpRUI/AAAAAAAABBk/ry2cD5pt7eM/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-02-24+at+11.22.59+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="250" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UGabibWAlr8/USpTz8VpRUI/AAAAAAAABBk/ry2cD5pt7eM/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-02-24+at+11.22.59+PM.png" width="400" /></a></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Install Xcode: Install Xcode,&nbsp;preferably&nbsp;the full version, if you might like to develop for iOS or iPad. It is a free download from App Store.</li><li>Install Homebrew: This is a must and it is really satisfies the need to package manager in OSX.</li><li>Install dotfiles: Please use dotfiles, there are many good ones already shared on Github. You can use any one of them from here. <a href="http://dotfiles.github.com/" target="_blank">Install Dotfiles</a></li><li>Install z, oh-my-zsh: Oh my zsh is one of the best and feature rich shell, do use it with combination of z. Z is a directory jumping tool and it is really handy. <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z" target="_blank">Install Z</a></li><li>Install and configure a text editor: Install Sublime Text2, Vim or Emacs as your text editor. They are most extensible and powerful editors and you can configure them to satisfy all your needs. Make sure you invest sometime configuring it to your taste and needs. It will be intensely productive and satisfying experience.</li><li>Install Node and NPM: If you are web developer , you must have dealt with JavaScript. You must install both of them. Not only it extends the package manager needs, it is basis of other good package managers for web.</li><li>Install Component, Yeoman, Bower and Grunt. These are some&nbsp;indispensable&nbsp;tools that are very important for any web /&nbsp;web app&nbsp;developer.</li><li>Install Chrome Canary: If you want to get the best Developer tools available , install chrome canary. It is the latest and provide great support for various things such as sass, compass etc inbuilt.</li><li>Install Google drive and dropbox: Please keep your important stuff in cloud so that you may never loose your data again. Also, you can backup your code in Github.</li><li>Install SizeUP: It is one of most productive software on mac and provides such great arrangement of Windows that you will be amazed. Either buy it or install the trial version.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Install Sizeup</a></li><li>Install Git and create a account on Github, if you haven't already. There is such a vibrant community on Github, mostly great web developers that if you are not updated with it.You will loose great deal of useful information.</li><li>Automate most of the grunt jobs you do daily. Use build tools such as Make, Cake, Jake etc. Also, learn little bit of shell scripting. It really helps in long run.</li><li>Install Python and the module install tools such a pip and easy_install. It is really a must.</li><li>Install Ruby and ROR. They have pretty good community. Just a basis google search will get you going about the install and use process.</li><li>Install VirtualBox, it is an invaluable thing if you have to use another OS such as Windows or Ubuntu.</li></ul><div>I guess these are pretty exhaustive list of TODOS if you using mac for web/web-app development. I will keep updating the post if i remember any more important thing. The baseline is that macs are great piece of hardware and a pretty decent OS, so invest sometime in setting it up. It will save you tons of time and frustation. Have a good weekend, Enjoy!</div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Starting with Front-End Development and looking for a robust setup?<br /><br />Install Ubuntu 12.04 and&nbsp;here are some of the tools and tips that could come handy if you are configuring it for the first time. I am not detailing on how to install these tools but rather would suggest on what could be good setup for&nbsp;development..<br /><b><br /></b><b>IDE</b>: This is where you spend most of the time. So choose wisely among Sublime Text2, Vim or Emacs. Vim and Emacs are entirely customizable and comes with loads of plugin that would really improve your&nbsp;efficiency. Sublime text is an awesome code editor and you must try it first as it is highly effective and has a lower learning curve. Also there are loads of good plugins available that makes it a handy tool.<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /><b>Servers</b>: Install&nbsp;Apache 2,&nbsp;nginx and Node. This would cover most of the modern web server stack. Though node is technically not a server. But I hope you get my point.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Once Node and npm are installed there are some indispensable packages you must use. <b><i>UglifyJS </i></b>among others is a pretty handy one.&nbsp;Install<b><i> Compass </i></b>and <b><i>CoffeeScript</i></b>, also setup up <b><i>jslint/jshint</i></b> with your IDE. It will ensure a habit of shipping out quality code.<br /><br /><b>Browser<i>: Use the latest and nightly builds of Chromium/&nbsp;Firefox</i></b>, you should work with latest once so not miss any good feature/ improvements.</div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Install the <i style="font-weight: bold;">latest production release of Ruby, Python and Java, PHP </i>or whatever is your choice of language.&nbsp;</li><li>Learn<b><i> Version control </i></b>such as <b>git</b> and invest some time to learn it. It would save you tonnes of time later.</li><li>Last but not the least use<a href="http://www.blogger.com/%C2%A0http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">&nbsp;yeoman</a>&nbsp;. It is really gem of a tool, it , it gives a robust set of tools , libraries and a workflow that most of top developers use. Invest sometime in learning and using it and you will be always glad that you did.&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Installing each one them on Ubuntu 12.04 is easy and obviously it is free and freakishly stable. Configure once and worry about the important aspects of&nbsp;development.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
