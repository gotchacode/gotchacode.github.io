<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Each one of us uses one Social Network or another. It was fine in the earlier days when it was connecting you to your long lost friend, colleague or someone you knew. But do we realize what it is doing to us now?<br /><div><br /></div><div>We are being subjected to information overload and that too in the worst form. There are endless stories about all the stuff that doesn't even matter to us. We are being fed so much about our friends that we are not even interested to know about them anymore. Sharing every crap that happens in your life is a common norm and anyone who doesn't stick to it is dated.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, that fact is, we should just shut this information overload and take control of our life. We don't really need to be subjected to this and become depressed and deprived people. Life has better meaning than all of it. We are born to do great things in life and not being sucked into this emotional and depressing wormhole that these Social Networks are creating.</div><div><br /></div><div>With that said, not all of the Social Networks are bad. Some of them like Twitter and Google+ gives us the option to minimise the intrusion of this excess information. So take a stand and control what kind of information gets to you. Clean up your friends and following list. Follow only those person and group you are really passionate &nbsp;about. Pick up some nice offline activity, meet some nice people , play some music, watch sunrise or sunset, start running etc. There are so many nice things to do. So just shut up laptop/tablets/smartphones and get some life people!</div></div>

There is one thing that is very noticeable about Google+ and that is the way it is evolving. When it first came in it had nothing very special so as to take Social Networking giant Facebook . But recently some very cool and clean looking features has been incorporated into Google+.<br/><br/>In the first screenshot you can see that there is a new navigation UI in Google+, just click the Google+ logo and you will get all the options such a profile page, Search, Images, Maps, Youtube, News, Gmail,Documents etc.<br/><br/>It might prove a very decisive move from Google+ to incorporate all the existing services that are being used by millions into Social Networking realm.The switch seems perfectly clean and everything works like wonders.<br/><br/>[caption id="attachment_568" align="alignleft" width="580" caption="New Way To Navigate in Google+"]<a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/pic.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-568" title="pic" src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/pic.png" alt="" width="580" height="326" /></a>[/caption]<br/><br/>Also in the next one we can see that a very portable YouTube player incorporated in the right, Just search in your favorite artist/band and it will be lined up in a convenient playlist. So you can actually use the Netflix kind of services for free and in many cases more better.<br/><br/>[caption id="attachment_571" align="alignleft" width="580" caption="YouTube Videos In A Cool Playlist Mode."]<a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/screenshot7.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-571" title="screenshot7" src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/screenshot7.png" alt="" width="580" height="326" /></a>[/caption]<br/><br/>This is the latest addition in Google+, a brand new share button so that you can update your status, add pics or whatever you wish even if u are using any of the Google services like gmail.<br/><br/>[caption id="attachment_572" align="alignleft" width="580" caption="New Share Button On The Top Sidebar Of Gmail and Google+"]<a href="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/pic3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-572" title="pic3" src="http://gotchacode.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/pic3.png" alt="" width="580" height="326" /></a>[/caption]<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>So Looking at the new features we can definitely predict that future seems bright for Google+ and though the growth is slow, it might be a steady and long lasting one.
