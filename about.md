title: About Vinit Kumar
---

I am a highly motivated, self driven web developer with skills in technologies such as Python, Django,
JavaScript, Ruby, Postgresql, MongoDB, Node.js, Git among others.
I favour standards based development and follow a disciplined approach to programming. I take pride and
ownership in the products I work. I constantly work hard on upgrading my skills and knowledge in my area of
expertise. I try to be platform/Language/framework agnostic due to which I am able to pick up technologies
pretty quickly and get productive in short time.
