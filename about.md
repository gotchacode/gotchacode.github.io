An experienced web developer with good exposure in JavaScript and Python based development. I invest a lot of thinking and effort in the products which results in good user experience and user interaction.

I have been writing both front-end and backend layers, so over the time I acquired a good understanding of building end to end solutions.

Quality programming, maintainable code and automation - These are three things I have high regards for. I play a lot with tooling to make development more productive. I don't use IDE's for programming and could do everything with my Editor (VIM).

In my free time, I love reading books (mostly computer science) or contributing to OSS.

I currently work at an awesome Dutch company Changer and my job involves building Safe and Secure Social Network for School kids : Socialschools.
